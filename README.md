# joke_teller
Using a text to speech API make an GIF tell the user a joke
The API key is public, but this a fun project. Will hide it in the future
Haven't worked with NodeJs, but would like to store the key on server to hide it on the front end also

At some point change the GIF robot into something more aesthetic
